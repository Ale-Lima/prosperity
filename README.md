# prosperity
The Prosperity project puts face to face the needs of a group or a community on the one hand and the people with the skills to solve them on the other.
Allow, with the help of the social media model through information systems, that the demands (needs) existing in the communities can be solved using both the competences of its members and resources available within the community itself as well as the competences and resources existing in the government and in class entities.
