# Prosperity
Hi, I'm Fernando Pelegrini and I live in São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo, Brazil. I'm taking the fullstack programmer course at Senai Technical School. I intend to start my project called Prosperity whose objective is to put face to face the needs of a group or community on the one hand and the people with the skills to solve them on the other. The application is to be used predominantly via mobile devices and the internet. I'm using html5, css3 and javascript.
